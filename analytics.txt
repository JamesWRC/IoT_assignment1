- With the data that you have, what kind of data visualisation graph should be used?
(Scatter plots, Bar charts and Histograms, Line plots, Pie charts, etc.)
Bar graph was better because you can compare values and to keep track of changes.

- What should be represented in the above graph? Why did you make that decision?
In the graph, we want to use temperature, humidity and created_at data. with humidity/temperature,
we can compare values with the other values of the other days. we can use created_at to display the dates underneath each temperature/humidity values.


- Python supports numerous data visualisation libraries. Which two libraries did you narrow it down to?
decided to use matplotlib and seaborn.

- an analytical comparison of the libraries used, advantages/disadvantages, simplicity/complexity, flexibility/configurations, anything you may think is necessary.

. Seaborn has nicer default aesthetics. Meaning that its default aesthetics are much more visually appealing than matplotlib.
. Matplotlib has default aesthetics.

. Seaborn are easy to customise aesthetics. you can change the background graph colour, you can set palette, the quality palette is good,
you can do sequential colour palette and you can diverge colour palettes.
. Matplotlib doesn't have much customising except you can only change the color of the bars.

. Seaborn are statistically-minded plots. meaning that seaborn has some built-in plots that matplotlib does not.
. For Matplotlib, you have to create your own dataset, create your own x-axis and y-axis and etc.
